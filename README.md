# oxygen-delivery-system-for-patients
This project's goal is to track and supply the oxygen produced for patients who have been admitted to the intensive care unit by medical professionals, nurses, and patients' visitors. Effective and smooth condition monitoring is crucial for ICU patients since they need intensive care and constant observation.
A doctor should report right away to the critical care unit whenever an emergency occurs, such as a rise in blood pressure, a heart attack, a stroke, etc. By gathering the medical information of every patient in the ICU, our project meets this demand. Doctors and nurses have access to this information at all times. So that medical professionals can immediately react to the patient, emergency circumstances might also be alerted.
Attendees are unhappy and dejected because they are forbidden from seeing ICU patients. By displaying the patient's status and precise information in virtual mode, this doubt about the attendee's condition can be eliminated. Also, it lessens disturbances for ICU patients and lets the family know how the patient is doing.
